# Task Manager — Vue 3 SPA

A single-page task manager. Register, sign in, and manage your own tasks. The client for
[task-manager-backend](https://github.com/trencho/task-manager-backend), a Spring Boot JWT API.

## Stack

| | |
|---|---|
| Language | TypeScript 6 (strict) |
| Framework | Vue 3.5 (Composition API, `<script setup>` single-file components) |
| Routing | vue-router 5, with per-route auth guards |
| HTTP | axios, with a shared instance that attaches the JWT and refreshes it on `401` |
| Build | Vite 8 |
| Type-check | `vue-tsc` |
| Tests | Vitest 4 + `@vue/test-utils` 2 |
| Lint | ESLint 10 (flat config) + `eslint-plugin-vue` + `typescript-eslint` |
| Package manager | **Yarn 4 (Berry)**, Corepack-pinned (`yarn.lock` is committed) |
| Deploy | Docker → nginx |

TypeScript is pinned to **6.x**, not the newer 7.x: `typescript-eslint` supports only `<6.1.0`, so 6.0
is the newest version the whole toolchain (vue-tsc + typescript-eslint) agrees on. This mirrors the
existing policy of holding tool majors until the ecosystem catches up.

There is **no Vuex or Pinia store.** State lives in the components; the auth tokens live in
`localStorage`, behind `src/utils/auth.ts`.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trencho/task-manager-frontend.git
cd task-manager-frontend
corepack enable            # activates the Yarn version pinned in package.json
yarn install --immutable   # installs exactly the committed lockfile
```

Yarn is managed by [Corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) (bundled with Node), so the
exact Yarn version comes from `package.json`'s `packageManager` field — no global install needed.
Use `yarn install --immutable`, not a plain `yarn install` — it fails when `package.json` and
`yarn.lock` disagree instead of quietly rewriting the lockfile.

## Configuration

The backend URL comes from `VITE_API_URL`. Only `VITE_`-prefixed variables reach the bundle, and
**whatever you put there is compiled into the published JavaScript** — never place a secret in it.

Leave it empty (the default) and the app issues **same-origin relative requests** to `/api/...`.
In development the Vite dev server proxies those to `VITE_DEV_PROXY_TARGET`, which defaults to
`http://localhost:80` — the backend's default port. In the Docker image, nginx proxies them to
`BACKEND_URL`. Set `VITE_API_URL` only to point a bundle at a *different* origin, which then
needs CORS on the backend.

```bash
yarn dev                                      # proxies /api to http://localhost:80
VITE_DEV_PROXY_TARGET=http://localhost:9000 yarn dev
VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com yarn build
```

| Variable | Where | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `VITE_API_URL` | build time | empty | Compiled into the bundle. Empty means same-origin. |
| `VITE_DEV_PROXY_TARGET` | `yarn dev` | `http://localhost:80` | Dev server only |
| `BACKEND_URL` | container run time | `http://spring:80` | Where nginx forwards `/api`. An unset value makes nginx refuse to start. |

See [`.env.example`](.env.example).

## Scripts

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `yarn dev` | Vite dev server with HMR on `:8080` |
| `yarn build` | Production bundle into `dist/` |
| `yarn preview` | Serve the built bundle locally |
| `yarn lint` | ESLint |
| `yarn type-check` | `vue-tsc` — type-checks `.ts` and `.vue` |
| `yarn test` | Vitest, 89 tests |
| `yarn coverage` | Vitest + v8 coverage |

CI runs `yarn install --immutable && yarn lint && yarn type-check && yarn test && yarn build` on every push and pull request.

### Routing

`/` redirects to `/login`. Routes are guarded: `requiresAuth` bounces anonymous visitors to
`/login`, and `requiresGuest` bounces signed-in users to `/tasks`.

### Authentication flow

`LoginForm` posts to `/api/auth/login` and stores the returned `accessToken` and `refreshToken`.
Every subsequent request goes through the axios instance in `utils/axiosSetup.ts`, which:

1. attaches `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>`;
2. on a `401`, calls `/api/auth/refresh-token` once, stores the **new access token and the
   rotated refresh token**, and replays the original request;
3. clears both tokens if that refresh itself fails, and does not replay the request.

A request is only retried once — a second `401` for the same request rejects. The refresh call
goes through a separate axios client with no interceptors, so a `401` from `/refresh-token`
cannot recurse back into the refresh handler.

### API used

| Call | Endpoint |
|---|---|
| Register | `POST /api/auth/signup` |
| Sign in | `POST /api/auth/login` |
| Refresh | `POST /api/auth/refresh-token` (returns a rotated refresh token) |
| Sign out | `POST /api/auth/logout` (revokes the refresh token) |
| List | `GET /api/tasks` — paginated (`page`, `size`), with optional `q`, `status`, `priority`, `dueBefore`, and `sort` from the filter bar |
| Create | `POST /api/tasks` |
| Update | `PUT /api/tasks/{id}` |
| Delete | `DELETE /api/tasks/{id}` |

## Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Builds the bundle and serves it through nginx (`nginx.conf`). See [`README.Docker.md`](README.Docker.md).

## Roadmap

Candidate features, derived from this README and the gaps between it and the code:

1. ~~**Set a task's status from the UI.**~~ Done. `TaskForm` has a status select bound to the
   backend's `TaskStatus`, and `TaskList` shows each task's status. "Mark tasks as complete" —
   claimed by an earlier version of this README, and impossible until now — works.
2. ~~**Sort tasks.**~~ Done. `TaskFilters` sorts by due date or title, ascending or descending,
   passed to `GET /api/tasks` as `sort`.
3. ~~**Filter and search.**~~ Done. `TaskFilters` sends `q` (title/description search), `status`,
   `priority`, and `dueBefore`; the backend matches on all four, combinable with pagination.
4. ~~**Surface API errors properly.**~~ Done. `ErrorBanner` shows failures in an inline, accessible
   region and `alert()` is gone — see `utils/errorMessage.ts`.
5. **Introduce a store (Pinia)** *if* shared state grows beyond auth tokens. Not needed today —
   and an earlier version of this README claimed one existed when it did not.
6. ~~**Log out server-side.**~~ Done. `LogoutButton` calls `POST /api/auth/logout`, which revokes
   the refresh token. The local session is cleared even if that call fails.
7. ~~**Replace Vue CLI with Vite.**~~ Done. `yarn npm audit` now reports **0** advisories, down from 9.

## Notes

- `yarn npm audit` reports **0 vulnerabilities**. The 9 advisories that used to sit in the build chain
  left with Vue CLI.
